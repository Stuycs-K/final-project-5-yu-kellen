### 5/22/2024

Played around with some GUI libraries (LazyGUI, ControlP5), made some skeleton classes like Cell and Grid3D. Still trying to figure out how this will all come together. Doing alot of reading and research.

### 5/23/2024

Played around more with GUI, having a better idea of how to simulate everything

### 5/25/2024

Didn't do much. :/

### 5/26/2024

Did some more GUI Stuff, trying to figure out how to simulate conductors in an electric field, dialectrics, all the fun stuff

More research. quite clueless on how to do things, played more around with the UI layout, rethinking class structures.

### 5/28/2024

Finally got a GUI layout in mind. Physics is real? I'm going to solve poisson's equations (the laplace of potential is equal to -charge density/permittivity. Going to use Finite Difference Method.

### 5/29/2024

render/slicing menu done. Added my laptop to the workflow
